	Areas of Similar Triangles

1.If △ ABC ~ △ DEF such that AB = 12 cm and DE = 14 cm. Find the ratio of areas of △ ABC and △ DEF.
A.	49/9
B.	36/49
C.	49/16
D.	25/49
2.	
2.	D and E are points on the sides AB and AC respectively of a △ABC such that DE || BC. Which of the following statement is true?
i.	△ ADE ~ △ ABC
ii.	(area of △ ADE/ area of △ ABC) = (AD2/AB2)
iii.	(area of △ ADE/ area of △ ABC)= (AB2/ AD2)
3.	
A.	only (iii)
B.	only (i)
C.	only (i) and (ii)
D.	all (i) , (ii) and (iii)
Answer: (i) △ ADE ~ △ ABC and (ii) (area of △ ADE/ area of △ ABC) = (AD2/AB2)
Solution:
 
In △ ADE and △ ABC, we have
∠ ADE = ∠ B
[Since DE || BC ∠ ADE = ∠ B (Corresponding angles)]
and, ∠ A = △ A [Common]
△ ADE ~ △ ABC
Therefore, (area of △ ADE / area of △ ABC) = (AD2/AB2)
3.	
3.	 
In the figure, PB and QA are perpendicular to segment AB. If OA = 5 cm, PO = 7cm and area (ΔQOA) = 150 cm2, find the area of ΔPOB.
3.	
3.	
A.	233 cm2
B.	294 cm2
C.	300 cm2
D.	420 cm2
Answer: (B)294 cm2
Solution: Consider Δ~QOA and Δ POB
QA || PB,
Therefore, ∠ AQO = ∠ PBO [Alternate angles]
∠ QAO = ∠ BPO  [Alternate angles]
and
∠ QOA = ∠ BOP [Vertically opposite angles]
Δs QOA ~ BOP  [by AAA similarity]
Therefore, (OQ/ OB) = (OA/OP)
Now, area (POB)/ area (QOA) = (OP) 2/ (OA) 2= 72/ 52
Since area (QOA) =150cm2
⇒area (POB) =294cm2
4.	
4.	Two isosceles triangles have equal angles and their areas are in the ratio 16: 25. The ratio of corresponding heights is:
A.	4:5
B.	5:4
C.	3:2
D.	5:7
Answer: (A) 4:5
Solution: For similar isosceles triangles,
Area (Δ1) / Area (Δ2) = (h1)2 / (h2)2
(h1 / h2) = 4/5
Basic Proportionality Theorem
5.	
5.	In △ABC, AB = 3 and, AC = 4 cm and AD is the bisector of ∠A. Then, BD : DC is —
A.	9: 16
B.	4:3
C.	3:4
D.	16:9
Answer: (C) 3:4
Solution:
 
The Angle-Bisector theorem states that if a ray bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the other two sides (It may be similar or may not depending on type of triangle it divides)
In △ABC
as per the statement AB/ AC= BD/DC i.e. a/b= c/d
So, BD/ DC= AB/AC= ¾
So, BD: DC = 3: 4
6.	
6.	ABCD is a parallelogram with diagonal AC If a line XY is drawn such that XY ∥ AB.
BX/XC=?
 
6.	
6.	
A.	(AY/AC)
B.	DZ/AZ
C.	AZ/ZD
D.	AC/AY
Answer: (C) AZ/ZD
Solution: In the Δ ABC,
AB ∥ XZ
AB ∥ XY
∴ BX/ XC= AY/YC…. (By BPT)….. (1)
In parallelogram ABCD,
AB ∥ CD
AB ∥ CD ∥ XZ
In the Δ ACD,
CD ∥ YZ
∴ AY/YC= AZ/ZD … (By BPT)…… (2)
From 1 & 2,
BX/XC= AY/YC= AZ/ZD
BX/XC= AZ/ZD

In ABC, Given that DE//BC, D is the midpoint of AB and E is a midpoint of AC. 
The ratio AE: EC is ____.
7.	
7.	
1.	1: 3
2.	1:1
3.	2:1
4.	1:2
Answer: (B) 1:1
Solution:
 
DE is parallel to BC
So, In triangles ABC, ADE
∠DAE = ∠ECF {Alternate angles}
∠ADE = ∠EFC {Alternate angles}
∠BAC = ∠DAE
By A.A.A similarity ABC≡ADE
⇒ AD/DB= AE/EC (Basic Proportionality Theorem)
Since, D is midpoint of AB.
AD=DB
⇒ AD/DB= 1/1=AE/EC
⇒ AE/EC= 1 /1
∴ AE: EC= 1:1
8.	
8.	In ΔABC, AC = 15 cm and DE || BC. If AB/AD=3, Find EC.
A.	5cm
B.	10 cm
C.	2.5cm
D.	9cm
Answer: (B) 10cm
Solution: Given: DE∥BC
From basic proportionality theorem
AD/DB=AE/EC
Now, AB/AD= (AD+DB) /AD= 1 + (DB/AD)
⇒1+ (DB/AD) = 3
⇒ (DB/AD) = 2
⇒ AD/DB=AE/EC = ½
⇒2AE=EC⇒AC=AE+EC−−−−−−− (1)
On substituting value of EC in (1), we get
15=3AE⇒5=AE⇒EC=10cm
Criteria for Similarity of Triangles
9.	
9.	△ ABC is an acute angled triangle. DE is drawn parallel to BC as shown. Which of the following are always true?
i) △ ABC ∼ △ ADE
ii) AD/BD= AE/EC
iii) DE= BC/2
 
9.	
9.	
A.	Only (i)
B.	(i) and (ii) only
C.	(i), (ii) and (iii)
D.	(ii) and (iii) only
Answer: (B) (i) and (ii) Only
Solution: Since DE || BC, AD/BD=AE/EC and hence △ABC ∼ △ADE
DE = BC/2 only if D and E are the mid points of AB and AC respectively. So this may not be true always.
10.	
10.	The triangles ABC and ADE are similar
 
Which of the following is true?
10.	
10.	
A.	EC/AC=AD/DE
B.	BC/BD=CE/DE
C.	AB/AD=BC/DE
D.	All of the Above
Answer: (C) AB/AD=BC/DE
Solution: Since the given triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.
So, AB/AD=BC/DE=AC/AE
11.	
11.	If in △ CAB and △ FED, AB/ EF=BC/FD=AC/ED, then:
A.	△ ABC∼△ DEF
B.	△ CAB∼△ DEF
C.	△ ABC∼△ EFD
D.	△ CAB∼△ EFD
Answer: (C) △ ABC∼△ EFD
Solution: If two triangles are similar, corresponding sides are proportional.
Therefore, △ABC∼△EFD.
12.	
12.	A tower of height 24m casts a shadow 50m and at the same time, a girl of height 1.8m casts a shadow. Find the length of the shadow of girl.
A.	3.75m
B.	3.5m
C.	3.25m
D.	3m
Answer: (A)3.75m
Solution: In △ABC and △DEC
∠ABC=∠DEC=90°
∠C=∠C (common)
Therefore, △ABC∼△DEC       [by AA similarity]
So, DE/AB=EC/BC
EC=DE × (BC/AB)
EC= 1.8× (50/24) ⇒EC=3.75 m
 
Pythagoras Theorem
13.	
13.	In the adjoining figure, if BC = a, AC = b, AB = c and   ∠CAB = 120°, then the correct relation is-
 
13.	
13.	
A.	a2 = b2 +  c2 – bc
B.	a2 = b2 +  c2 + bc
C.	a2 = b2 +  c2 – 2bc
D.	a2 = b2 +  c2 + 2bc
Answer: (B)a2 = b2 +  c2 + bc
Solution: In △CDB,
BC2 =  CD2 + BD2      [By Pythagoras Theorem]
BC2 =  CD2 + (DA+AB)2 
BC2 =  CD2 + DA2 + AB2 + (2×DA×AB)         (i)
In △ADC,
CD2 + DA2 = AC2      (ii)  [By Pythagoras Theorem]
Also, Cos60∘ = AD/AC
AC = 2AD       (iii)
Putting the values from (ii) and (iii) in (i), we get
BC2 =  AC2 + AB2 + (AC×AB)
a2 = b2 +  c2 + bc
Alternatively,
 Since  ∠A is an obtuse angle in  ΔABC, so
BC2 =  AB2 +  AC2 + 2AB . AD
= AB2 +  AC2 + 2×AB× ½ ×AC
[∵ AD = AC cos  60∘ = 1/2AC]
= AB2 +  AC2 + AB × AC
a2 = b2 +  c2 + bc.
14.	
14.	If the distance between the top of two trees 20 m and 28 m tall is 17 m, then the horizontal distance between the trees is :
A.	11m
B.	31m
C.	15m
D.	9m
Answer: (C) 15m
Solution: Let AB and CD be two trees such that AB = 20 m, CD = 28 m & BD = 17 m
 
Draw BE parallel to CD. Then, ED = 8 m.
By applying Pythagoras theorem:
BE2+DE2=BD2
∴ 
 =15m
∴ AC = BE = 15 m
15.	
15.	 
In the figure △ABC is a right angled triangle with right angle at B. BD is perpendicular to AC. Then which of the following options will hold true?
15.	
15.	
A.	AD2=DC×AC
B.	AB2=AD×AC
C.	AB2=AD×DC
D.	AB2=DC2+AD2
Answer: (B)AB2=AD×AC
Solution:
 
In △ABC and △ADB
∠ABC=∠ADB=90°
∠A=∠A (common angle)
Therefore, △ABC∼△ADB      [by AA similarity]
AB/AD= AC/ AB
AB2=AC×AD
16.	
16.	In a right △ABC, a perpendicular BD is drawn on to the largest side from the opposite vertex. Which of the following does not give the ratio of the areas of △ABD and △ACB?
 
16.	
16.	
A.	(AB/AC)2
B.	(AD/AB)2
C.	(AB/AD)2
D.	(BD/CB)2
Answer: (C) (AB/AD)2
Solution:
Consider  ΔABD and ΔACB:
 
∠BAD =  ∠BAC    [common angle]
∠BDA =  ∠ABC     [ 90°]
By AA similarity criterion, △ABD ~ △ACB
Hence,
ar (ΔABD)/ ar(ΔACB) = (AB/AC)2= (AD/AB)2= (BD/CB)2
Similar Triangles
17.	
17.	△ ABC is such that AB = 3 cm, BC = 2 cm and CA = 2.5 cm.△ DEF is similar to △ABC. If EF = 4 cm, then the perimeter of △DEF is –
A.	7.5 cm
B.	15cm
C.	30cm
D.	22.5cm
Answer: (B) 15cm
Solution: AB/DE= AC/DF=BC/EF=2/4=1/2
DE = 2×AB = 6 cm, DF = 2×AC = 5 cm
∴ Perimeter of △DEF = (DE + EF + DF) = 15 cm.
18.	
18.	In △ ABC and △ DEF, ∠A = ∠E = 40∘ and AB/ED=AC/EF. Find ∠B if ∠F is 65°
A.	85°
B.	75°
C.	35°
D.	65°
Answer: (B) 75°
Solution:
 
AB/ED= AC/EF (Given)
∠A = ∠E = 40°
Since, the ratio of adjacent sides and the included angles are equal.
∴△ABC is similar to △EDF by SAS similarity criterion.
Now, ∠C = ∠F = 65°       [Corresponding angles of a similar triangles are equal]
∴ ∠B = 180°− (∠A+∠C)
=180° – (40° + 65°) = 75°
19.

Solution: Ratio of heights = Ratio of sides = 1: 3.
